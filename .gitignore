# There are 2 possible reasons to have .cabal files:
# 1. To let others use this repo as a dependency – it's very unlikely,
# at least at this point.
# 2. To support building with cabal – for that we also need to maintain
# cabal.project.
# In order to avoid overhead of keeping .cabal files in sync we just don't
# commit them.
