# Overview

This specification is based on the following documents:

- [BaseDAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTMOntqvxbHmjaERqETmqw0hy2f8JdVsjNyhpWUOqDo/edit#)

- Tezos Token Standard: [FA2][FA2]

The contract described here consists of two parts:
- Token functionality (FA2-based).
- DAO functionality with proposals and voting.

These two parts are coupled into one smart contract because interaction between smart contracts in Tezos is expensive and hard to get right.

# General Requirements

- The contract must be FA2 compatible as to facilitate listing on
  exchanges and interaction with services which support FA2.

- The contract must store tokens of two types: frozen (`token_id` is 1) and unfrozen (`token_id` is 0).

- The storage of the contract must have annotations for all fields
  and must be documented to make its interpretation easy for users.

# State model

This chapter provides a high-level overview of the contract's state.
Note that the actual storage type is implementation detail and is not specified here.

**TODO**

## Roles

The token supports one "global" user role: `Administrator`. This role applies to the
whole contract (hence "global"):

* **administrator**
  - Can re-assign this role to a new address.
  - There always must be exactly one administrator.
  - [TODO]: Add DAO functionality

Additionally, the contract inherits the **operator** role from FA2.
This role is "local" to a particular address.
Each address can have any number of operators and be an operator of any number of addresses.

# Errors

In error scenarios the stablecoin contract fails with a string or a pair where the first item is a string.
Here is a summary of all the strings used as error messages.
We start with standard FA2 errors which are part of the FA2 specification.

| Error                      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FA2_TOKEN_UNDEFINED`      | One of the specified `token_id`s is not defined                             |
| `FA2_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Cannot debit from a wallet because of excessive amount of tokens            |
| `FA2_NOT_OPERATOR`         | A transfer is initiated neither by the token owner nor a permitted operator |

The next group consists of the errors that are not part of the FA2 specification.

| Error                          | Description                                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR`            | The sender is not the administrator                    |
| `NOT_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR`    | Authorized sender is not the current pending administrator |
| `NO_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR_SET` | Throws when trying to authorize as the pending administrator whilst is not set for a contract |
| `NOT_TOKEN_OWNER`              | Trying to configure operators for a different wallet which sender does not own                |
| `QUORUM_NOT_MET`               | **TODO**                                               |

* [`token_metadata_registry`](#token_metadata_registry)
* [`update_operators`](#update_operators)
* [`mint`](#mint)

Format:
```
**entrypoint_name**

<optional pseudocode description of the parameter type>
Parameter (in Michelson): X

<description>
```

* Top-level contract parameter type MUST have all entrypoints listed below.
* Each entrypoint MUST be callable using the standard entrypoints machinery of Michelson by specifying **entrypoint_name** and a value of the type `X` (its argument).
* The previous bullet point implies that each `X` must have a field annotations with the corresponding entrypoint name.
In the definitions below it may be omitted, but it is still implied.

Pseudocode is semi-formally defined as a list of assignments where the last assignment has `entrypoint_name` on the left and its argument type (that maps to `X`) on the right.

Note: pseudocode is provided only for readability.
If Michelson type contradics what's written in pseudocode, the Michelson defition takes precedence.

## Standard FA2 Token Functions

Functions present in the [*FA2 Tezos Token Standard*][FA2].

### **transfer**

Types
```
token_id = nat

transfer_destination =
  ( address :to_
  , token_id :token_id
  , nat :amount
  )

transfer_param =
  ( address :from_
  , list transfer_destination :txs
  )

transfer = list transfer_param
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(list %transfer
  (pair
    (address %from_)
    (list %txs
      (pair
        (address %to_)
        (pair
          (nat %token_id)
          (nat %amount)
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- This entrypoint MUST follow the FA2 requirements.

- Permission logic follows the default permissions descriptor specified in FA2.

- Although the contract supports two types of tokens: frozen token (`token_id = 1`) and unfrozen token (`token_id = 0`), all `token_id` values passed to this entrypoint MUST be 0.

- If the destination address is the `freeze_my_tokens` address:
  - This entrypoint MUST update the unfrozen token balance(`token_id = 0`) according to FA2 requirement.
  - It MUST also increase the frozen token balance (`token_id = 1`) of the source address by the amount specified in the parameter.

- The administrator can transfer tokens from any address to any address.

### **balance_of**

Types
```
token_id = nat

balance_of_request =
  ( address :owner
  , token_id :token_id
  )

balance_of_response =
  ( balance_of_request :request
  , nat :balance
  )

balance_of =
  ( list balance_of_request :requests
  , contract (list balance_of_response) :callback
  )
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair %balance_of
  (list %requests
    (pair
      (address %owner)
      (nat %token_id)
    )
  )
  (contract %callback
    (list
      (pair
        (pair %request
          (address %owner)
          (nat %token_id)
        )
        (nat %balance)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- This entrypoint MUST follow the FA2 requirements.

- Since the contract supports two types of tokens: frozen token (`token_id = 1`) and unfrozen token (`token_id = 0`), all `token_id` values passed MUST be either 0 or 1.

### **token_metadata_registry**

Types
```
token_metadata_registry is contract (address)
```

Parameter (in Michelson)
```
(contract %token_metadata_registry address)
```

- Return contract address that holds token metadata.

### **update_operators**

Types
```
token_id = nat

operator_param =
  ( address :owner
  , address :operator
  , token_id :token_id
  )

update_operator_param =
  | Add_operator    operator_param
  | Remove_operator operator_param

update_operators = list update_operator_param
```

Parameter (in Michelson)
```
(list %update_operators
  (or
    (pair %add_operator
      (address %owner)
      (pair
        (address %operator)
        (nat %token_id)
      )
    )
    (pair %remove_operator
      (address %owner)
      (pair
        (address %operator)
        (nat %token_id)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- This entrypoint MUST follow the FA2 requirements.

- Although the contract supports two types of tokens: frozen token (`token_id = 1`) and unfrozen token (`token_id = 0`), all `token_id` values passed to this entrypoint MUST be 0, because transfers are supported only for unfrozen tokens.

- Each `owner` must be equal to `SENDER`, otherwise `NOT_TOKEN_OWNER` error occurs.

## Custom (non-FA2) token functions

Functions related to token transfers, but not present in FA2. They do not have `token_id` argument because only unfrozen token is supported (`token_id = 0`) and not necessary (since they are not part of FA2).

### **mint**

Types
```
mint =
  ( address :to_
  , nat     :value
  )
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair
  (address %to_)
  (nat %value)
)
```

- Produces the given amounts of tokens to the wallet associated with the given address.
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.

### **burn**

Types
```
burn =
  ( address :to_
  , nat     :value
  )
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair
  (address %to_)
  (nat %value)
)
```

- Reduce the given amounts of tokens to the wallet associated with the given address.
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.
- Fails with `FA2_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` if the wallet associated with the given address
does not have enough tokens to burn.

## Role reassigning functions

### **transfer_ownership**

Types
```
transfer_ownership = address
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
address
```

- Initiate transfer of the role of administrator to a new address.

- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.

- The current administrator retains his privileges up until
  `accept_ownership` is called.

- Can be called multiple times, each call replaces pending administrator with
  the new one. Note, that if proposed administrator is the same as the current
  one, then the pending administrator is simply invalidated.

### **accept_ownership**

Types
```
accept_ownership = unit
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
unit
```

- Accept the administrator privilege.

- Fails with `NOT_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the current pending administrator or `NO_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR_SET` if there is no pending administrator.
