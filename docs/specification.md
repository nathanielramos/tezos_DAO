# Overview

This specification is based on the following documents:

- [BaseDAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTMOntqvxbHmjaERqETmqw0hy2f8JdVsjNyhpWUOqDo/edit#)

- Tezos Token Standard: [FA2][FA2]

The contract described here consists of two parts:
- Token functionality (FA2-based).
- DAO functionality with proposals and voting.

These two parts are coupled into one smart contract because interaction between smart contracts in Tezos is expensive and hard to get right.

# General Requirements

- The contract must be FA2 compatible as to facilitate listing on
  exchanges and interaction with services which support FA2.

- The contract must store tokens of two types: frozen (`token_id` is 1) and unfrozen (`token_id` is 0).

- The storage of the contract must have annotations for all fields
  and must be documented to make its interpretation easy for users.

# Configuration

BaseDAO is not a concrete smart contract, but rather a framework to implement various DAOs.
It can be configured in compile-time for any specific needs.
"Compile-time" configuration refers to the compilation of the smart contract to Michelson.
That is, in order to get Michelson version of the contract one has to configure it first.

The smart contract is implemented in Haskell eDSL Lorentz which allows us to have 2 types of configuration:
1. Type parameters that should be instantiated to specific types by DAO creator.
2. Michelson constants, including lambdas, that can be passed as Haskell values.

BaseDAO has 1 type parameter `proposalMetadata` that defines the structure of a proposal.
It contains fields that are required to submit a proposal.
It can contain any fields.
Here is an example of "treasury" style DAO:
```haskell
data ProposalMetadata = ProposalMetadata
  { mutezAmount :: Mutez
  , recipientId :: Text
  , agoraPostId :: Natural
  ...
  }
```

Compile-time value parameters are captured by the `Config` type (parameterized by `proposalMetadata`):

```haskell
data Config proposalMetadata = Config
  { cDaoName :: Text
  -- ^ Name of the DAO.
  , cDaoDescription :: Text
  -- ^ Description of the DAO.
  , cProposalCheck :: Lambda (Natural, Proposal proposalMetadata) Bool
  -- ^ A lambda used to verify whether a proposal can be submitted.
  -- It checks 2 things: the proposal itself and the amount of tokens frozen upon submission.
  -- It allows the DAO to reject a proposal by arbitrary logic and captures bond requirements
  -- (i. e. how much one should "freeze" in order to propose).
  , cUnfrozenTokenMetadata :: FA2Metadata
  -- ^ FA2 metadata for unfrozen token.
  , cFrozenTokenMetadata :: FA2Metadata
  -- ^ FA2 metadata for frozen token.
  , cDecisionLambda :: Lambda
      (Proposal proposalMetadata, Storage proposalMetadata)
      (List Operation, Storage proposalMetadata)
  -- ^ The decision lambda is executed based on a successful proposal.
  , cRejectedProposalReturnValue :: Lambda Natural Natural
  -- ^ When a proposal is rejected, the value that voters get back can be slashed.
  -- This lambda specifies how many tokens will be received.
  -- For example, if Alice freezes 100 tokens to vote and this lambda divides the value by 2,
  -- only 50 tokens will be unfrozen and other 50 tokens will be burnt.
  }
```

The `FA2Metadata` type matches `token_metadata` defined in FA2.
The `Proposal` type is defined below.
`Storage` is the full storage type of the contract.

## Runtime configuration

Some configuration values are specified in runtime and can be changed during the contract lifetime.
They must be provided on origination to construct the contract's initial storage.
These values are:
1. `administrator :: Address` is the address that can perform administrative actions.
2. `votingPeriod :: Natural` specifies how long the voting period lasts.
3. `quorumThreshold :: Natural` specifies how many total votes are required for a successful proposal.

# Contract logic

This chapter provides a high-level overview of the contract's logic.

- The contract maintains a ledger of address and its balance (frozen and unfrozen tokens)
- The contract manages a special role called "Administrator".
- The contract stores a list of proposals with one of the states: "ongoing", "rejected", or "accepted".
- After a successful migration, the contract `migrated` state will be `True` and all the subsequent
  operation will fail with `CONTRACT_MIGRATED` and the updated contract address.

## Roles

The token supports one "global" user role: `Administrator`. This role applies to the
whole contract (hence "global"):

* **administrator**
  - Can re-assign this role to a new address.
  - Can perform administrative operations.
  - Can trasfer FA2 tokens owned or operated by this contract.
  - There always must be exactly one administrator.

Additionally, the contract inherits the **operator** role from FA2.
This role is "local" to a particular address.
Each address can have any number of operators and be an operator of any number of addresses.

## Proposals

Everyone can make a new proposal, however, you have to freeze some tokens for that.
The proposer specifies how many tokens they want to freeze and this value is checked by
the contract according to its compile-time configuration.
If this value is accepted and the proposer has enough unfrozen tokens, these unfrozen tokens
are frozen and voting starts.
Apart from that the proposer specifies how many tokens one should lock in order to vote on this proposal.

Proposals are identified by a natural number.
A counter is used to assign identifiers to proposals.
So proposal IDs are 0, 1, 2â€¦

## Voting

Once a proposal is submitted, everyone can vote on it as long as they have enough unfrozen tokens.
The exact value is specified in the proposal.
The tokens are frozen for the duration of voting.
Voting period is specified for the whole smart contract and can be updated by the administrator.
It's possible to vote positively or negatively.
After the voting ends, the contract is "flushed" by calling a dedicated entrypoint.

## Ledger

Every address that is stored in ledger is associated with its unfrozen token balance and
frozen token balance.
When unfrozen tokens are transferred, the balance of the `from_` addresses is decreased
and the balance of the `to_` addresses is increased according to the transferred values.

<!--
# Storage

The storage must be a nested tree of `pair`s with field annotations.
It must contain the following fields:
-->

# Errors

In error scenarios the baseDAO contract fails with a string or a pair where the first item is a string.
Here is a summary of all the strings used as error messages.
We start with standard FA2 errors which are part of the FA2 specification.

| Error                      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FA2_TOKEN_UNDEFINED`      | One of the specified `token_id`s is not defined                             |
| `FA2_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Cannot debit from a wallet because of excessive amount of tokens            |
| `FA2_NOT_OPERATOR`         | A transfer is initiated neither by the token owner nor a permitted operator |

The next group consists of the errors that are not part of the FA2 specification.
The list of erros may be inaccurate and incomplete, it will be updated during the implementation.

| Error                          | Description                                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR`            | The sender is not the administrator                          |
| `NOT_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR`    | Authorized sender is not the current pending administrator   |
| `NO_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR_SET` | Throws when trying to authorize as the pending administrator whilst is not set for a contract |
| `NOT_TOKEN_OWNER`              | Trying to configure operators for a different wallet which sender does not own                |
| `PROPOSAL_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Throws when trying to propose a contract without having enough unfrozen token                |
| `VOTING_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Throws when trying to vote on a proposal without having enough unfrozen token                |
| `PROPOSAL_NOT_EXIST`           | Throws when trying to vote on a proposal that does not exist |
| `QUORUM_NOT_MET`               | A proposal is flushed, but there are not enough votes        |
| `CONTRACT_MIGRATED`            | Throw when conract has been migrated        |

**entrypoint_name**

<optional Haskell definition of the argument type>
Parameter (in Michelson): X

<description>
```

* Top-level contract parameter type MUST have all entrypoints listed below.
* Each entrypoint MUST be callable using the standard entrypoints machinery of Michelson by specifying **entrypoint_name** and a value of the type `X` (its argument).
* The previous bullet point implies that each `X` must have a field annotations with the corresponding entrypoint name.
In the definitions below it may be omitted, but it is still implied.

Note: Haskell definitions are provided only for readability.
If Michelson type contradicts what's written in Haskell definition, the Michelson definition takes precedence.

## Standard FA2 Token Functions

Functions present in the [*FA2 Tezos Token Standard*][FA2].

### **transfer**

```haskell
type TokenId = Natural

data TransferDestination = TransferDestination
  { to_ :: Address
  , token_id :: TokenId
  , nat :: Natural
  }

data TransferParam = TransferParam
  { from_ :: Address
  , txs :: [TransferDestination]
  }

type TransferParams = [TransferParam]

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Transfer TransferParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(list %transfer
  (pair
    (address %from_)
    (list %txs
      (pair
        (address %to_)
        (pair
          (nat %token_id)
          (nat %amount)
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- This entrypoint MUST follow the FA2 requirements.

- Permission logic follows the default permissions descriptor specified in FA2.

- Although the contract supports two types of tokens: frozen token (`token_id = 1`) and unfrozen token (`token_id = 0`), all `token_id` values passed to this entrypoint MUST be 0.

<!--
- If the destination address is the `freeze_my_tokens` address:
  - This entrypoint MUST update the unfrozen token balance(`token_id = 0`) according to FA2 requirement.
  - It MUST also increase the frozen token balance (`token_id = 1`) of the source address by the amount specified in the parameter.
-->

- The administrator can transfer tokens from any address to any address.

### **balance_of**

```haskell
type TokenId = Natural

data BalanceRequestItem = BalanceRequestItem
  { owner :: Address
  , token_id :: TokenId
  }

data BalanceResponseItem = BalanceResponseItem
  { request :: BalanceRequestItem
  , balance :: Natural
  }

type BalanceRequestParams =
  View [BalanceRequestItem] [BalanceResponseItem]

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Balance_of BalanceRequestParams
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair %balance_of
  (list %requests
    (pair
      (address %owner)
      (nat %token_id)
    )
  )
  (contract %callback
    (list
      (pair
        (pair %request
          (address %owner)
          (nat %token_id)
        )
        (nat %balance)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- This entrypoint MUST follow the FA2 requirements.

- Since the contract supports two types of tokens: frozen token (`token_id = 1`) and unfrozen token (`token_id = 0`), all `token_id` values passed MUST be either 0 or 1.

### **token_metadata_registry**

```haskell
type TokenMetadataRegistryParam = ContractRef Address

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Token_metadata_registry TokenMetadataRegistryParam
```
Parameter (in Michelson)
```
(contract %token_metadata_registry address)
```

- Return contract address that holds token metadata.
- Token metadata MUST include the DAO metadata.

### **update_operators**

```haskell
type TokenId = Natural

data OperatorParam = OperatorParam
  { owner :: Address
  , operator :: Address
  , token_id :: TokenId
  }

data UpdateOperator
  = Add_operator OperatorParam
  | Remove_operator OperatorParam

type UpdateOperatorsParam = [UpdateOperator]

data Parameter
  = Update_operators UpdateOperatorsParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson)
```
(list %update_operators
  (or
    (pair %add_operator
      (address %owner)
      (pair
        (address %operator)
        (nat %token_id)
      )
    )
    (pair %remove_operator
      (address %owner)
      (pair
        (address %operator)
        (nat %token_id)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- This entrypoint MUST follow the FA2 requirements.

- Although the contract supports two types of tokens: frozen token (`token_id = 1`) and unfrozen token (`token_id = 0`), all `token_id` values passed to this entrypoint MUST be 0, because transfers are supported only for unfrozen tokens.

- Each `owner` must be equal to `SENDER`, otherwise `NOT_TOKEN_OWNER` error occurs.

## Custom (non-FA2) token functions

Functions related to token transfers, but not present in FA2. They do not have `token_id` argument because only unfrozen token is supported (`token_id = 0`) and not necessary (since they are not part of FA2).

### **mint**

```haskell
data MintParam = MintParam
  { to_ :: Address
  , amount :: Natural
  }

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Mint MintParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair
  (address %to_)
  (nat %value)
)
```

- Produces the given amounts of tokens to the wallet associated with the given address.
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.

### **burn**

```haskell
data BurnParam = BurnParam
  { to_ :: Address
  , amount :: Natural
  }

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Burn BurnParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair
  (address %to_)
  (nat %value)
)
```

- Reduce the given amounts of tokens to the wallet associated with the given address.
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.
- Fails with `FA2_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` if the wallet associated with the given address
does not have enough tokens to burn.

### **transfer_contract_tokens**

```haskell
type TokenId = Natural

data TransferDestination = TransferDestination
  { to_ :: Address
  , token_id :: TokenId
  , nat :: Natural
  }

data TransferParam = TransferParam
  { from_ :: Address
  , txs :: [TransferDestination]
  }

type TransferParams = [TransferParam]

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Transfer_contract_tokens Address TransferParams
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair %transfer_contract_tokens
  address
  (list
    (pair
      (address %from_)
      (list %txs
        (pair
          (address %to_)
          (pair
            (nat %token_id)
            (nat %amount)
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- This entrypoint can be used by the administrator to transfer tokens owned (or operated) by this contract in another FA2 contract.
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.
- If the outermost address passed to this entrypoint is a smart contract with FA2 `transfer` entrypoint, this entrypoint is called with supplied argument.
That is, the list of operations returned from the baseDAO contract should contain one `TRANSFER_TOKENS` operation calling the `transfer` entrypoint.
Otherwise the call fails.

- Although the contract supports two types of tokens: frozen token (`token_id = 1`) and unfrozen token (`token_id = 0`), all `token_id` values passed to this entrypoint MUST be 0.

## Role reassigning functions

### **transfer_ownership**

```haskell
type TransferOwnershipParam = Address

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Transfer_ownership TransferOwnershipParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
address
```

- Initiate transfer of the role of administrator to a new address.

- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.

- The current administrator retains his privileges up until
  `accept_ownership` is called.

- Can be called multiple times, each call replaces pending administrator with
  the new one. Note, that if proposed administrator is the same as the current
  one, then the pending administrator is simply invalidated.

### **accept_ownership**

```haskell
data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Accept_ownership
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
unit
```

- Accept the administrator privilege.

- Fails with `NOT_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the current pending administrator or `NO_PENDING_ADMINISTRATOR_SET` if there is no pending administrator.

## Proposal entrypoints

### **propose**

```haskell
data Proposal proposalMetadata = Proposal
    { frozen_token_requirement :: Natural
    -- ^ How many tokens should be frozen in order to vote on this proposal.
    , metadata :: proposalMetadata
    }

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Propose Natural (Proposal proposalMetadata)
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair %propose
  nat
  (pair
    (nat %frozen_token_requirement)
    (<proposal_type> %metadata)
  )
)
```

- The proposal is saved and assigned a unique numeric proposal ID.
- The `Natural` value (let's say `n`) determines how many sender's tokens will be frozen.
- Sender MUST have enough unfrozen tokens (i. e. `â‰¥ n`).
- Fails with `PROPOSAL_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` if the unfrozen token balance of the SENDER
  is less than `n`.
- Fails if the proposal is rejected by `cProposalCheck` from the configuration.
- The sender's balance in frozen tokens is increased by `n` and in unfrozen tokens is decreased by `n`.

### **proposal_metadata**

```haskell
type ProposalId = Natural

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = ProposalMetadata (View ProposalId (Proposal proposalMetadata))
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair %proposal_meatadata
  (nat %requests)
  (contract %callback <proposal_type>)
)
```

- Return the proposal associated with the id.

- Fails with `PROPOSAL_NOT_EXIST` if the proposal id is
  not associated with any ongoing proposals.

### **set_voting_period**

```haskell
data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = SetVotingPeriod Natural
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
nat
```

- Update how long the voting period lasts for new proposals
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.

### **set_quorum_threshold**

```haskell
data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = SetQuorumThreshold Natural
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
nat
```

- Update the amount of votes which is required for a successful proposal for new proposals
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.

### **vote**

```haskell
type ProposalId = Natural

type VoteType = Upvote | Downvote

data VoteParam = VoteParam
  { proposal_id :: ProposalId
  , vote_type :: VoteType
  }

data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Vote VoteParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson):

```
(pair %vote
  (nat %proposal_id)
  (bool %vote_type)
)
```

- Let `n` denote the amount of tokens required by the associated proposal to vote.
- Sender MUST have enough unfrozen tokens (i. e. `â‰¥ n`).
- Fails with `VOTING_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` if the unfrozen token balance of the SENDER
  is less than `n`.
- Fails with `PROPOSAL_NOT_EXIST` if the proposal id is not associated with any ongoing proposals.
- The sender's balance in frozen tokens is increased by `n` and in unfrozen tokens is decreased by `n`.

### **token_address**

```haskell
data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Token_address (ContractRef Address)
```

Parameter (in Michelson)
```
(contract %token_address address)
```

- Return the address of the associated FA2 contract.
- Since FA2 logic is embedded into this contract, this entrypoint always returns `SELF`.

### **flush**

```haskell
data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Flush
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
unit
```

- Finish voting process on all proposals for which voting period is over.
- Frozen tokens from voters and proposal submitter associated with those proposals are returned
  in form of unfrozen tokens:
  - If proposal got rejected or the quorum was not met: the return amount are slashed based on `cRejectedProposalReturnValue`.
  - If proposal got accepted: the return amount are returned in total.
- If proposal is accepted, decision lambda is called.

## Migrating functions

### **migrate**

```haskell
data Parameter proposalMetadata
  = Migrate Address
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
address
```

- After a successful `migrate` call, the contract is permanently set to the `migrated` state, no operations are possible.
- The address denotes the new DAO address.
- Fails with `NOT_ADMINISTRATOR` if the sender is not the administrator.
